The company intended to use this software as a quick means of quality testing their products.

We were building an Android application for a product named Smart Floor Sport - a floor that tracks athlete positions and allows gathering data on their speed, movements, tactics and much more. For me, this was a great learning experience as an Android developer, as well as an insight into how modern tech companies operate. More information about the project is available at https://www.smartfloor.com/.</p>",
